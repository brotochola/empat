# TODO

- implement bubbles in a particle system on click
- have a json with an array of levels

  {id:0,question:"what color is the highlighted fish?", answer:"red", numOfFish:30, numOfPlants:3,plantReproductionSpeed:0.1,fishSpeed:0.5, worldWidth:1920}

- implement speechRecognition to answer to the questions

- have a method in the game that simulates recieving a new level (have some tooltip showing)

- implement bitmapfont and show numbers like points

- add ui

- add comments
- make sure everything is loading when it has to

- add random rocks at start

- make fish avoid those that are not their type

- make sure fish dont go too far from the screen limit

- make bg fish all the same type -it will look better and it will be more like the other fish' behaviour


# NICE TO HAVE:
- rocks with physics, user can grab them, fish avoid rocks
- fish age, fish reproduce, fish eat, fish die
- day cycle
- "shark" in the background, inherits from fish, type bgfish, all the other fish avoid it.

# POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:
what color is the highlighted fish?
what color is the highlighted plant?
how many red fish are there?
how many rocks are there?
